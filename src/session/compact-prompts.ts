/**
 * Compact-phase prompt templates (P2.3).
 *
 * Used by Session's compact machinery (_runCompactPhase / runManualCompact).
 * Wording changes here directly shape continuation quality after compaction.
 *
 * INVARIANT — keep the two prompts in sync. Writing a continuation prompt is a
 * universal task, so OUTPUT (before_turn) and TOOLCALL (mid_turn) share an
 * identical body. They diverge in EXACTLY one dimension: whether an unprocessed
 * tool result is in flight at compact time. That single difference justifies
 * only the two TOOLCALL-only pieces — the "[SYSTEM: COMPACT REQUIRED] … you just
 * made a tool call" framing, and the precise "where exactly did we stop" prompt.
 * Everything else (mission, the do-not-do-the-work guard, the self-check
 * questions, the preserve-more rule, the imperative ending) MUST stay identical.
 * Edit one, edit the other. Drift here is what once left the imperative ending
 * in TOOLCALL but missing from OUTPUT.

// -- Compact Prompt: Output scenario --
export const COMPACT_PROMPT_OUTPUT = `Produce a **continuation prompt** — a briefing for a fresh instance of yourself, with zero access to this conversation, that must seamlessly pick up where we left off. Your only job right now is to write that briefing — do not start or continue the actual work.

**Before writing the continuation prompt**, make sure any stable, long-term knowledge from this session has been written to AGENTS.md if it belongs there.

**What the new instance will already have:** your system prompt and AGENTS.md persistent memory are automatically re-injected after compact. Do not duplicate their contents in the continuation prompt — focus on what they don't cover: current progress, session-specific context, and in-flight work state.

Use whatever structure best fits the actual content — there is no fixed template. As you write, pressure-test yourself against these questions:

- **What are we trying to do?** The user's intent, goals, and any constraints or preferences they've expressed — stated or implied.
- **What do we know now that we didn't at the start?** Key discoveries, failed approaches, edge cases encountered, decisions made and *why*.
- **Where exactly are we?** What's done, what's in progress, what's next. Be specific enough that work won't be repeated or skipped.
- **What artifacts exist?** Files read, created, or modified — with enough context about each to be actionable (not just a path list).
- **What working style has the user shown?** Communication preferences, collaboration patterns, or how they like to collaborate.
- **What explicit rules has the user stated?** Direct instructions about how to work, what not to do, approval requirements, or behavioral constraints the user has explicitly communicated (e.g., "don't modify code until I approve", "always run tests before committing"). Preserve these verbatim — they are binding rules, not suggestions.

**Err on the side of preserving more, not less.** The continuation prompt is the sole bridge between this conversation and the next — anything omitted is permanently lost to the new instance. Include all information that could plausibly be useful for subsequent work: partial findings, open questions, code snippets you'll need to reference, relevant file paths with context. A longer, thorough continuation prompt that preserves useful context is far better than a terse one that forces the new instance to re-discover things.

Write in natural prose. Use structure where it aids clarity, not for its own sake.

End the continuation prompt with a clear, imperative statement of what the new instance should do first upon resuming.`;

You just made a tool call and received its result above. That result is real and should be reflected in your summary, but do not act on it.
