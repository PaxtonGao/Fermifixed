## Context Commands

### `/summarize`

Opens an interactive range picker:

1. Select the **start** turn
2. Select the **end** turn
3. Optionally provide a **focus prompt** — instructions about what to preserve

The selected range is converted to context IDs and summarized. Key decisions and findings are preserved; the rest is discarded.

```text
/summarize
```

See [Context Management](/guide/context) for details.

### `/compact`

Full context reset with a continuation summary. Optionally provide instructions:

```text
/compact
/compact Preserve the DB schema decisions
```

After compact, the agent starts with a fresh context window containing only the continuation summary and AGENTS.md files.

### `/summarize_hint`

Configure the two automatic hints that nudge the agent to summarize as context fills up. Toggle them on/off, or set custom trigger percentages:

```text
/summarize_hint on
/summarize_hint off
/summarize_hint 50 75
```

The two integers are the Level 1 and Level 2 trigger percentages and must satisfy `0 < level1 < level2 < 85`. The setting persists. See [Context Management](/guide/context).

### `/rewind`

Roll back to a previous turn. Opens a picker showing turn history. Reverts both the conversation **and** file system changes made after that turn.

```text
/rewind
```

File revert uses tracked mutations (edits, writes, bash mkdir/cp/mv) with conflict detection — if a file was modified externally after the agent changed it, the rewind skips that file and reports the conflict.

### `/review`

Run a code review. Opens a picker to choose what to review:

```text
/review
```

- **Against a base branch** — review the diff vs. a base branch
- **Uncommitted changes** — review the current working-tree changes
- **A commit** — review a specific commit by SHA
- **Custom instructions** — provide your own review focus

You can also pass instructions inline: `/review check for SQL injection risks`. The picker supports adding extra instructions (Tab) to any option.

## Model Commands

### `/model`

Opens a hierarchical picker showing all configured providers and models. Select one to switch immediately.

For managed providers with missing API keys (Kimi, MiniMax, GLM, DeepSeek, Xiaomi, Qwen), selecting a model can prompt you to paste or import the key on the spot.

### `/key`

Manage a provider's API key directly — add, replace, remove, or import a detected external env var. Opens a picker of provider endpoints, then an action menu. Keys are stored in `~/.fermi/.env` (`0600`). This is the quickest way to rotate or fix a key without re-running `fermi init`.

### `/tier`

Configure which models sub-agents use at each tier level (high, medium, low). When the agent spawns a sub-agent with `model_level="low"`, it uses the model you assigned to the low tier.

## Permission & Safety

### `/permission`

Set the permission mode for tool execution:

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `read_only` | Only read tools auto-allowed; all writes require approval |
| `reversible` | Read + reversible writes auto-allowed |
| `yolo` | Everything auto-allowed except catastrophic operations |

### `/autoupdate`

Toggle background update checks:

```text
/autoupdate on
/autoupdate off
```

When enabled, Fermi checks GitHub Releases in the background, stages patch/minor updates automatically, and applies them on the next restart.

### `/hooks`

Show all registered hooks and their configuration. Hooks are shell commands that run in response to events (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, UserPromptSubmit, etc.).

## Session Commands

### `/session`

Resume a previous session. Shows a list of saved sessions with timestamps. Select one to restore its full conversation state.

```text
/session
/session <id>
```

### `/new`

Start a new session. The current session is auto-saved first.

### `/project`

Open a recent Project, enter an existing directory, or create an empty directory-backed Project. The current Session is saved before switching. A Project without a Skill Profile asks you to choose Skills first; use Space to toggle and Enter to confirm. Creation does not run `git init` or add repository files.

### `/fork`

Fork the current session into a new branch — creates a copy of the current state that you can take in a different direction.

### `/rename`

Give the current session a descriptive name for easier identification in the session list.

## Other Commands

### `/skills`

Opens a checkbox picker for global Skill defaults. Projects without a Profile inherit these defaults.

### `/proskills`

Opens the complete Skill Catalog for the current Project. Confirming saves an exact allowlist in Fermi's system-managed Project storage and reloads Skills immediately. The Profile is independent of later global changes.

### `/mcp`

Connects configured MCP servers and lists discovered tools. Useful as a health check before starting work.

### `/agents`

Toggles the agents panel — the main agent and any running sub-agents with their status.

### `/todos`

Toggles the todo panel, which shows the agent's current plan/task list.

### `/theme`

Set the TUI theme mode: `auto`, `light`, or `dark`. Persisted to `settings.json` (`theme_mode`).

### `/diff`

Set how write/edit diffs are rendered: `compact` or `full`. Persisted to `settings.json` (`diff_display`).

### `/codex` / `/copilot`

OAuth login flows for OpenAI (ChatGPT) and GitHub Copilot respectively.

### `/copy`

Copy the agent's most recent text response to the system clipboard.

### `/raw`

Toggle between rendered markdown and raw markdown display. Also available as `/md`.

### `/shells`

View tracked background shells and stop them. Background shells come from `bash_background` or from a `bash` call that ran past its timeout and was handed off to the background.

### `/usage` and `/stat`

`/usage` (alias `/context`) shows the current session's token usage — how much of the context budget is consumed and the breakdown by category. `/stat` shows your all-time token statistics across every session.

### `/autocopy`

Toggle copy-on-select. When on, selecting text with the mouse automatically copies it to the clipboard (with a brief toast), so you don't need a separate copy step.

```text
/autocopy on
/autocopy off
```
